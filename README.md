# Welcome To Cute Puppy Finder!

Try it out! : https://cutepuppyfinder.netlify.app/ 

I wanted to create a simple application that retrieves random cute pictures of puppies for the user.

When the user clicks the _Find Puppy_ button, the blank placeholder will provide new random pictures and videos of puppies.
The button will access the URL for the _Random Dog API_ and retrieves json data back in the form of an image or GIF.

At times the URL will provide a broken image that can not be displayed.

**Javascript** allows the user to access data from the API. This will also work with other URLs that provides images as well so feel free!
